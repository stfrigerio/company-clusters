                "text": "Research & Development Therapeutic focus Scientific background Clinical Trials TGCT CSF-1R inhibition Tumour Microenvironment TANGENT References Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumour (TGCT) is a typically benign but sometimes aggressively growing tumour in the synovial lining of joints, tendon sheaths or bursae, primarily located in knee, hip, and ankle. TGCT is caused by excessive production of CSF-1 as a result of a chromosome abnormality. TGCT is a serious and chronically debilitating disease in which patients experience severe pain, swelling, loss of function of the affected joints and diminished quality of life. TGCT is usually found in adults aged 20-50 years old, but it may also be found in children1. Symptoms of these tumours are often initially like those of other conditions, such as sports injuries or arthritis, so they may initially be difficult to diagnose and treat effectively. TGCT can affect nearly every aspect of a person\u2019s daily life. Common everyday activities, such as walking or shopping, can be very tough for people with TGCT. There are generally two types of TGCT: localised TGCT and diffuse TGCT, which is less common and more difficult to treat. The estimated global incidence of TGCT overall is 43 cases per million patient years, with 4 per million patient years of these estimated as being diffuse TGCT2. Surgery is often the first-line treatment approach. Some diffuse tumours may be inoperable due to the size or location of the tumour within the joint. Surgery may damage portions of the joint lining and high recurrence rates of up to 50%3 for diffuse TGCT, often requiring multiple surgeries, have been reported. Excessive damage to the joint may lead to the requirement of a joint replacement or amputation. Leveraging the preliminary efficacy, safety and PK-PD data in more than 450 patients, we believe emactuzumab could add significant advantages over existing treatment options for patients with TGCT. TANGENT, our Phase III registrational clinical study, will add to the encouraging data we have generated already, and advance our TGCT programme into the late stages clinical development. We ultimately aim to provide a best-in-class treatment option to address the unmet needs, and improve the quality of life of TGCT patients suffering from this chronically debilitating disease. Chief Executive Officer The monoclonal antibody emactuzumab is a potent, specific inhibitor of CSF-1R and data generated to date show its potential as a therapeutic platform targeting serious macrophage-driven inflammatory, fibrotic and neovascular diseases. The CSF-1 receptor, via its binding to two regulatory cytokines, CSF-1 and IL-34, is critically involved in the regulation of macrophages and related cells in multiple biological processes across many organ systems, making it an attractive target with broad therapeutic applications. TGCT is caused by a translocation error in chromosome 1 and chromosome 2, which results in an overproduction of a protein called colony stimulative factor 1 (CSF-1). In healthy cells, CSF-1 helps white blood cells to grow and develop. The overproduction of CSF-1 triggers the migration of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) to tumour sites. TAMs suppress the T-cell mediated immune response. Emactuzumab blocks the CSF-1R on TAMs, enhancing T-cell infiltration and anti-tumour T-cell immune response. Emactuzumab was originally discovered and developed by Roche and has been tested in several phase 1a/b studies as monotherapy and in combination with other agents, including chemotherapeutics and immunotherapies in patients with a variety of solid tumours. It was demonstrated that emactuzumab monotherapy led to a substantial tumour response (ORR of 71%)4 and improvements in functional ability of patients with good tolerability and a manageable safety profile in patients with diffuse TGCT. Disease: Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumour (TGCT) Phase: Phase III Study title: A Phase III, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-Blind Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Emactuzumab vs. Placebo in Subjects with Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumour More info: Clinicaltrials.gov For more information for medical professionals or patients interested in joining our pivotal phase III trial, please see our patient site TANGENT is a global Phase III trial for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with TGCT. Most patients currently receive surgical intervention \u0003as the primary course of treatment, with high rates of post-surgery recurrence. TANGENT provides an option for TGCT patients, both adults and adolescents, that are not amenable for surgery or that have relapsed from previous treatment including systemic therapies with TKIs and/or other CSF-1R inhibitors. Current treatment options for TGCT patients are limited, with surgical resection being the most common treatment option, and no approved medical treatment in the EU, despite the risks of complications of high rates of recurrence, long recovery times, and issues of pain management. Therefore, developing new and effective pharmacological treatment options\u0003is highly desirable. Jean-Yves Blay M.D, PhD, Principal Investigator Lyon, France"

The current 5-year relative survival rate for patients with distant metastases in colorectal cancer is only 15%. There is an urgent need to develop less toxic and more effective agents for the metastatic stage of the disease. Nanoligent aims to improve the lives of patients by designing new medicines that selectively target the cells affected by disease. They have developed a new drug, NNL-121, that targets the CXCR4 receptor, which is overexpressed in 50% of metastatic colorectal cancer patients. The problem they are addressing is the lack of targeted and effective treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer, which is a major cause of patient death.",

Senescent cells are cells that contribute to chronic diseases and cancer progression by secreting pro-inflammatory factors. Cleara's unique approach involves identifying different subtypes of senescence and developing specific and safe compounds to selectively eliminate them. Their lead development candidates, CL04177 and CL04183, have shown promising results in preclinical models for metastatic colon cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. These compounds have favorable pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and stability, making them effective in reducing metastatic burden and infiltration. Cleara's goal is to progress these compounds into clinical development and use them as precision medicine against specific diseases, with associated biomarkers. Their expertise lies in understanding the molecular and biological pathways underlying these pathological phenotypes and exploiting their weak spots for safe and selective clearance. By developing subtype-specific anti-senescence compounds, Cleara aims to restore tissue homeostasis and improve human healthspan.",

They have created a unique 4-in-1 platform that combines synthetic biology, cell and gene therapy to address multiple targets in these complex diseases.\n\nTheir lead product, AUP-16, has shown excellent results in clinical studies for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). They have also obtained pre-clinical results for other chronic wounds and ovarian cancer. Unlike existing treatments that only target one biological target, Aurealis Therapeutics' 4-in-1 technology allows them to hit multiple targets simultaneously, making their therapies more effective and disease-modifying.\n\nThe company's platform is based on genetically modified lactic acid bacteria that can synthesize multiple human therapeutic proteins. These bacteria act as millions of bioreactors in the body, producing the desired proteins to promote wound healing and fight cancer. Aurealis Therapeutics is the only company in the world to have genetically engineered bacteria expressing three human therapeutic proteins.\n\nTheir approach is backed by pre-clinical and clinical results, demonstrating its potential in a wide range of applications. By activating different biologic targets, Aurealis Therapeutics aims to restart the wound healing process in chronic non-healing wounds and provide effective treatment for deadly cancers.\n\nIn addition to their unique technology platform, Aurealis Therapeutics has also partnered with Xbiome for the clinical development and commercialization of their therapy AUP-16 in Greater China. This partnership allows them to expand their reach and bring their game-changing technology to millions of patients worldwide.\n\nOverall, Aurealis Therapeutics offers breakthrough solutions for chronic wounds, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Their 4-in-1 platform and genetically modified bacteria set them apart from other therapeutic options, providing superior efficacy, safety, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and delivery of therapeutic agents.",

On the other hand, 2D cell culture models have limitations in terms of their ability to mimic the natural contractile movement of cardiomyocytes in the human heart. River BioMedics has developed a 3D Cardiac Strip assay using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that can assemble different cell types of the human heart, providing a more human-relevant cardiac model for target validation and drug discovery in cardiovascular disease.",

                            "Text": "Currently, pre-clinical studies rely mainly on animal models, which have shown over and over again to have an insufficient predictive value for the human heart.\nThe significant differences in genome sequence, protein expression, muscle anatomy and physiology between the rodent and human heart have hampered the development of new drugs for heart failure.\nThe most commonly used in vitro model for heart disease is a 2D cell culture of cardiomyocytes, which is nothing more than a layer of cardiomyocytes attached to a plastic or glass surface.\nThis culture format has the major disadvantage that plastic and glass are stiff surfaces, thereby completely restraining the natural contractile movement of cardiomyocytes.\nSince cardiomyocytes in 2D cultures are not able to contract or relax like they do in real human heart tissue, the use of 2D cultures for target validation and discovery for heart failure is limited.\nAt River BioMedics, we are experts in differentiating human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into the different cell types which make up the human heart, including cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, and cardiac endothelial cells, which can be used to make a human relevant cardiac model.\nTo do this the hiPSC-derived cardiac cells are assembled into a 3D cardiac tissue, in the shape of a strip (therefore also called a \u201c3D Cardiac Strip\u201d).\nThis strip is suspended between two flexible cantilevers to allow for easy measurement of force and relaxation tension.",

Lancet.\n2018 River BioMedics was founded in 2020 by Marcelo Ribeiro, Lisanne Blauw and Robert Passier, as a spin-out from the University of Twente\u2019s department of Applied Stem Cell Technologies.\nThe team has built a suite of 3D cardiac models including, 3D cardiac strips, heart-on-a-chip and the highly innovative mini heart, to support their drug discovery programmes and enable partnerships.\nWith the current financing round, River BioMedics will start 2 drug discovery programs on cardiac specific targets.",

They use a technology called Aptamers, which are small RNA molecules that can bind to specific target molecules in the body. These Aptamers act as a platform tool to deliver different therapeutic agents with high specificity and improved safety to treat various types of cancers. \n\nWhat makes Aptadel's approach unique is that their Aptamers mimic small, protein-binding molecules and exhibit high binding affinity and selectivity. They can be chemically synthesized and modified, allowing for flexibility in their use. Aptamers can be conjugated to other chemical entities, such as chemotherapeutic agents, siRNA, nanoparticles, and solid phase surfaces, for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. \n\nAptadel has developed an Aptamer specific for the tyrosine-kinase receptor EphA2, which is implicated in various processes crucial to malignant progression. They propose a treatment for EphA2-expressing tumors based on multifunctional RNA-based molecules that target the expression of this key receptor. \n\nTheir main program focuses on fighting childhood cancer, particularly Ewing Sarcoma, which is a rare and aggressive type of cancerous tumor. Aptadel's platform allows for the targeting of a wide variety of cancer types, and they have specific programs targeting pediatric and adult cancers. \n\nOverall, Aptadel Therapeutics offers a unique and innovative approach to delivering RNA-based therapies to cancer cells, with the potential to improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates.",

Current treatment options for cancer often lack specificity and can have adverse side effects. Aptadel's focus on delivering RNA-based therapies to cancer cells aims to improve the targeting and safety of these treatments. By using Aptamers, small RNA molecules that can bind to specific target molecules, Aptadel is able to enhance the specificity and selectivity of their therapies. This approach addresses the challenge of effectively delivering therapeutic agents to cancer cells while minimizing off-target effects. Additionally, Aptadel's specific focus on childhood cancer, particularly Ewing Sarcoma, highlights the need for improved treatment options for rare and aggressive forms of cancer. Overall, Aptadel Therapeutics is working to overcome the limitations of current cancer treatments by developing innovative RNA-based therapies that can target cancer cells with high specificity and improved safety.",

Their mission is to bring these therapies to patients and establish positive relationships with patients, physicians, partners, and the community. They are supported by leading biotech investors and have a disease-first focus.\n\n2. The key features of VICO Therapeutics' product, the VICOMER\u2122 RNA Modulating Platform, are what sets them apart. Their platform offers multiple modalities to modulate RNA, including translation, splicing, editing, degradation, and activation. This allows them to select the specific type of RNA modulator best suited to correct the genetic defect in each disease. They apply precision chemistry to achieve optimal efficacy and safety, ensuring reversible and transient changes to RNA without permanent changes to DNA code.\n\nVICO Therapeutics' antisense oligonucleotides, which are simple synthetic but biodegradable stretches of nucleotides, allow for high sequence-specificity and straightforward optimization of structure activity relationship. They also implement state-of-the-art chemical modifications to fine-tune their therapeutic approach. Their platform technology is built on significant experience in designing, manufacturing, and developing antisense oligonucleotides as RNA modulating therapeutics.\n\nThe company's lead product candidate, VO659, is an allele-preferential antisense oligonucleotide designed to target expanded CAG repeats in mutant mRNA transcripts. It aims to reduce the levels of mutant proteins associated with polyglutamine diseases such as Spinocerebellar Ataxia types 3 and 1 (SCA3, SCA1) and Huntington's disease (HD). In preclinical studies, significant reductions in mutant protein levels and improvements in motor function were observed.\n\nVICO Therapeutics' approach also extends to other genetic neurological disorders, such as Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) and Huntington's disease (HD). They aim to suppress mutant proteins and slow or halt disease progression by targeting the underlying genetic defects. Their therapeutic strategy includes antisense oligonucleotide-mediated RNA editing to repair mutant genes and reverse symptoms.\n\nOverall, VICO Therapeutics' unique combination of a disease-first focus, multiple RNA modulating mechanisms of action, precision chemistry, and a platform built on extensive experience in antisense oligonucleotide development positions them as a leader in developing innovative therapies for genetic neurological diseases.",

VICO Therapeutics aims to suppress these mutant proteins and slow or halt disease progression by developing innovative RNA modulating therapies. Their approach involves targeting the underlying genetic defects using antisense oligonucleotides to modulate RNA.

Their goal is to discover and develop innovative biologics as new therapeutic options for millions of diabetic patients worldwide. They are specifically focused on regenerating insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas to increase insulin production and potentially eliminate the need for exogenous insulin in some patients.\n\nThe key feature of DiogenX's product is their lead drug candidate, a novel recombinant protein that activates the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in pancreatic beta cells. This pathway is responsible for the replication of beta cells, and by modulating it, DiogenX's drug candidate can induce the replication of functional insulin-producing beta cells. This approach has shown efficacy in preventing and reversing diabetes in preclinical experiments.\n\nWhat makes DiogenX unique is that their drug candidate has the potential to become the first off-the-shelf solution to regenerate pancreatic beta cells and the first disease-modifying treatment for symptomatic type 1 diabetes. Their approach offers a unique profile for symptomatic patients, as it aims to restore the patient's own beta cells and pancreatic function. This could have broad clinical utility, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatments.\n\nIn addition, DiogenX's drug candidate has shown long-term tolerability in preclinical studies, indicating its potential to safely intervene on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. By restoring functional pancreatic function, their drug candidate could also help avoid episodes of hypoglycemia, a common side effect of insulin administration.\n\nOverall, DiogenX's innovative approach and drug candidate have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of type 1 diabetes by regenerating insulin-producing beta cells and reducing the burden of frequent insulin injections for diabetic patients.",

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by the loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to a reliance on exogenous insulin. Currently, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies for type 1 diabetes, and patients must undergo frequent insulin injections to manage their condition. This reliance on insulin therapy can be burdensome and may lead to complications such as hypoglycemia. Additionally, the global prevalence of diabetes is increasing, with an estimated 700 million adults projected to have the disease by 2045. DiogenX aims to address this problem by developing a regenerative treatment that can restore the function of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. By modulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, their drug candidate has shown promise in preclinical studies for inducing the replication of functional beta cells. If successful, this approach could potentially eliminate the need for exogenous insulin in some patients and reduce the burden of frequent injections.",

By developing antibodies that inhibit iRhom2, SciRhom's drug candidates can simultaneously block multiple pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, providing a more effective treatment option for patients. What sets SciRhom apart is their ability to selectively target immune cells while leaving important cellular functions intact, avoiding the side effects seen in previous attempts to block the enzyme directly. Their approach has shown promising results in preclinical studies, demonstrating superior efficacy compared to standard treatments. Additionally, SciRhom has secured comprehensive patent protection for their anti-iRhom2 antibodies, ensuring exclusivity and safeguarding against similar drugs. With their recent increase in funding, SciRhom is accelerating the development of their drug candidates and working towards IND approval, bringing them closer to providing a game-changing therapy for autoimmune diseases.",

These conditions can cause discomfort, vision impairment, and even permanent damage if left untreated. Currently, there is a lack of immediate access to effective treatments for these pathologies, leaving patients without proper care. This creates a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. NuVision aims to ensure that no patient goes without immediate access to treatment for ocular surface pathologies. By developing innovative ocular biotherapies, such as their flagship product Omnigen, NuVision is providing a solution to this problem.",

These types of cancers often have poor prognosis and limited treatment options, leading to high mortality rates. Current therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation, can have significant side effects and may not effectively target cancer cells. \n\nThe company recognizes the need for more targeted and efficient therapies that can specifically kill cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy cells. They aim to optimize the function of natural killer (NK) cells, which are part of the body's immune system and have the ability to kill cancer cells. By genetically modifying these NK cells and enhancing their cytotoxicity, ONK Therapeutics aims to develop next-generation NK cell therapies that can effectively target and kill cancer cells in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. \n\nThe company's focus on engineering strategies to enhance tumor homing and persistence in-vivo, as well as overcoming exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment, highlights the challenges faced in current cancer treatments. By addressing these challenges, ONK Therapeutics aims to improve the efficacy and safety of cancer therapies, ultimately providing better treatment options for patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors.",

ADCs are a type of treatment that delivers anticancer drugs directly to cancer cells by targeting specific molecules on their surface. Adcendo was founded in 2017 as a spin-out from The University of Copenhagen and Rigshospitalet, and since then, they have been focused on refining and deepening the proof-of-concept data for their uPARAP ADC program. They have established themselves at the Copenhagen Bio Science Park (COBIS) and have built a highly experienced leadership team and a skilled group of scientific employees. Adcendo's mission is to make a meaningful difference for cancer patients by leveraging innovation and a passion for science.\n\n2. Adcendo's key product is their highly differentiated antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for the treatment of underserved cancers. ADCs are a unique drug modality that combines the specificity of antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic drugs. What sets Adcendo apart is their focus on targeting the uPARAP receptor, which is overexpressed on the surface of certain cancer cells. By specifically targeting this receptor, Adcendo's ADCs can deliver the anticancer drugs directly to the malignant cells, minimizing damage to healthy cells and potentially increasing the effectiveness of the treatment. This targeted approach has shown promising results in pre-clinical research, with a first-generation anti-uPARAP ADC demonstrating a curative outcome in a CDX model. Adcendo's commitment to scientific evidence and facts, as well as their dedication to delivering outstanding results, positions them as a leader in the development of ADCs for cancers with a high unmet medical need.",

They are using new insights into dendritic cell biology to discover and develop novel small molecules and biologic medicines. Dendritic cells are specialized cells in our immune system that play a crucial role in alerting the immune system to potential disease-causing agents. Adendra's scientific foundation is based on the pioneering work of Caetano Reis e Sousa at The Francis Crick Institute, who has uncovered how dendritic cells orchestrate immune responses to cell death. \n\nWhat sets Adendra apart is their proprietary technology that builds on this understanding of dendritic cell activity and aims to expand and adapt it to various cell types. By doing so, they can direct a finely calibrated immune response to different diseases. For example, in the case of cancer, Adendra aims to train other immune cells to behave like dendritic cells, prompting a hypervigilant immune response to eliminate tumors. On the other hand, in autoimmune disorders, they seek to develop therapeutics that inhibit dendritic cells from over-reacting to dead cells, thus reducing T cell-driven autoimmunity. \n\nOverall, Adendra Therapeutics is at the forefront of leveraging dendritic cell biology to develop next-generation immunotherapies that have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of cancer and other diseases.",

The problem lies in the limited understanding of dendritic cell biology and their role in orchestrating immune responses to cell death. Dendritic cells are crucial in alerting the immune system to potential disease-causing agents, but their activity and signaling mechanisms are not fully understood. This lack of knowledge hinders the development of effective immunotherapies that can direct a finely calibrated immune response to different diseases. Additionally, dysregulation of dendritic cell signaling can lead to T cell-driven autoimmunity, further highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of dendritic cell biology. Adendra Therapeutics aims to address this problem by leveraging new insights into dendritic cell biology and developing innovative immunotherapies that can boost control of cancer, infection diseases, and autoimmune disorders.",

Their programs are centered around eliminating Regulatory T cells and hyperactivating Natural Killer cells in the tumor microenvironment. They achieve this through the use of monoclonal antibodies that specifically target immune cells to treat cancers. \n\nOne of their key products is the next generation anti-CD25 antibody, which they presented at the SITC Congress. This antibody is designed to deplete Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) while sparing effector T cells, leading to a boost in Natural Killer (NK) cell activity. By targeting CD25, Alderaan Biotechnology aims to develop a more effective and precise treatment for cancer. This approach is unique because it focuses on modulating immune cells to specifically target cancer cells, potentially leading to improved outcomes for patients. \n\nOverall, Alderaan Biotechnology's innovative approach to cancer treatment, using monoclonal antibodies to modulate immune cells, shows promise in developing more targeted and effective therapies for cancer patients.",

Their lead program, AP-01 or TAX2, targets a protein called thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) that is overexpressed in tumors. By blocking the activation of a receptor called CD47, AP-01 modulates the tumor microenvironment, converting highly vascularized tumors into poorly angiogenic ones and activating the immune system to inhibit tumor growth. \n\nWhat sets AP-01 apart is its unique mode of action, which avoids the hematologic toxicities associated with other CD47 blockade therapies. This allows AP-01 to fully exploit the potential of targeting the CD47 axis for cancer therapy. The efficacy of AP-01 has been supported by extensive in vivo data, demonstrating its ability to activate T-cells, stimulate the production of interferon gamma, and significantly reduce tumor size.\n\nIn addition to its anti-cancer properties, AP-01 also shows promise in controlling platelet activation and related thrombotic disorders, with a favorable safety profile and low bleeding risk. This makes it a potential candidate for combination therapies in the field of immune-oncology.\n\nApmonia Therapeutics leverages its expertise in protein/protein interaction analysis and molecular design to develop a pipeline of highly selective and safer drug candidates for cancer therapy. Their current focus is on orphan indications and colorectal cancer, with plans to target other indications such as glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer in the future.\n\nOverall, Apmonia Therapeutics aims to transform breakthrough scientific discoveries into innovative pharmaceutical therapies that improve the lives of cancer patients. Their approach of targeting the tumor microenvironment and modulating immune responses sets them apart in the field of cancer treatment.",

By destroying the endothelial cells in the tumor blood vessels, CimCure's vaccines aim to efficiently prevent tumor growth. Additionally, targeting the tumor blood vessels can overcome the barrier function of the tumor vasculature for leukocytes, potentially improving the efficacy of immunotherapy.

                            "Text": "Science DNA Replication Oncogene-induced DNA Replication Stress Synthetic Lethality:\nTurning Replication Stress against Cancer Cells References DNA replication is a well-regulated process that duplicates the genome before each cell division.\nThis process begins at specific genomic loci termed \u201corigins of replication\u2019\u2019.\nDNA replication involves first licensing and then firing of the DNA replication origins.\nIn human cells licensing occurs during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, at which time thousands of replication origins are established along the genome.\nDNA synthesis, also referred to as origin firing, occurs in S phase and requires activation of specific cyclin-dependent kinases.\nDNA replication is carried out in a bidirectional fashion; two replication forks start from each origin and proceed in opposite directions.\nDNA replication is completed when forks from adjacent origins converge.\nA key step in the development of most cancers is the acquisition of mutations in genes (oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes) that regulate cellular proliferation.\nIn parallel, in most cancers there are, paradoxically, difficulties in duplicating the genome, due to stalling and collapse of the DNA replication forks, a phenomenon known as \u201cDNA replication stress\u201d.\nOncogene activation is one of the main sources of DNA replication stress, which, in turn, leads to DNA breaks and genomic instability1,2.\nThe latter helps drive cancer progression and resistance to therapy, as it allows for the establishment of mutations that favor tumor growth and adaptation to diverse conditions3,4.\nOncogenes induce DNA replication stress by perturbing the cell cycle.\nSpecifically, oncogenes stimulate premature entry of cells into S phase, the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle.\nAs a consequence, specific DNA replication origins, which are silenced in normal cells, fail to be silenced in cancer cells5.\nThese \u201concogene-induced DNA replication origins\u2019\u2019 are present in highly-transcribed genes; as such, forks from these origins are prone to collapse due to replication-transcription collisions.\nCollapsed DNA replication forks need to be repaired for cells to duplicate their genome.\nThe principal repair pathway for collapsed DNA replication forks is \u201cbreak-induced replication\u201d6.\nSince fork collapse is much more frequent in cancer cells than in normal cells, cancer cells are more dependent on break-induced replication for their survival than normal cells.\nSynthetic lethality refers to the genetic principle in which the combination of two genetic perturbations is lethal, where each individually is not.\nOncogene-induced DNA replication stress, a hallmark of cancer7, makes cancer cells dependent on repair pathways for collapsed DNA replication forks.\nFoRx Therapeutics is developing small chemical inhibitors of these repair pathways to specifically target cancer cells, while sparing normal cells.\n1.\nBartkova J, Rezaei N, Liontos M, Karakaidos P, Kletsas D, Issaeva N, et al.

The company's compounds that disrupt DNA replication in cancer cells could offer a potential partnership or licensing opportunity for these startups to further their research and development efforts.\n\nBad user targets: \nCancer patients and their families: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Cancer patients and their families are a target audience as they are directly affected by the disease and are always looking for new treatment options. The company's compounds that disrupt DNA replication in cancer cells could offer hope for more effective treatments and potentially improved outcomes.\n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: While cancer patients and their families are directly affected by the disease and are always looking for new treatment options, they are not the primary users of the company's compounds. The compounds are still in the development stage and would need to go through regulatory approval processes before being available for patient use. Therefore, targeting cancer patients and their families at this stage may create false hope and unrealistic expectations.\n\nRegulatory agencies and policymakers: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Regulatory agencies and policymakers are a target audience as they play a crucial role in approving and regulating new cancer treatments. The company's compounds that disrupt DNA replication in cancer cells would need to go through regulatory approval processes, making these agencies and policymakers important stakeholders in the company's success.\n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: While regulatory agencies and policymakers are important stakeholders in the approval and regulation of new cancer treatments, they are not the primary users of the company's compounds. Their role is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the compounds, but they do not directly benefit from or use the compounds in their day-to-day work. Therefore, targeting regulatory agencies and policymakers may not be the most effective use of resources in the initial stages of the company's development.",

They have developed a unique technology platform called Shielded-Cell & Immunotherapy Pairs\u2122 (SCIP\u2122) that aims to transform hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and adoptive cell therapies. \n\nTheir technology involves modifying naturally occurring cell surface proteins in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to create novel variants that maintain their function but are resistant to depletion when targeted by immunotherapies. This means that their modified HSCs can be transplanted into patients without being destroyed by the immune system. \n\nThe key feature of Cimeio's product is their cell-shielding technology, which protects transplanted cells from depletion while allowing immunotherapies to selectively target and eliminate diseased cells. This improves the eligibility and outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplants and adoptive cell therapy. \n\nWhat sets Cimeio apart is their use of gene editing tools to insert these novel protein variants into HSCs, making them resistant to depletion by immunotherapies. This technology has significant therapeutic potential and can be used to develop curative treatments for genetic diseases, hematologic malignancies, and severe autoimmune disorders. \n\nIn summary, Cimeio Therapeutics offers a unique solution that combines gene editing and immunotherapy to improve the effectiveness and safety of hematopoietic stem cell transplants and adoptive cell therapy. Their cell-shielding technology protects transplanted cells while allowing targeted elimination of diseased cells, offering new treatment options for patients with various medical conditions.",

Their goal is to address a wide range of diseases that involve the gut-brain-liver axis, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\nWhat makes Cytoki Pharma unique is their lead product, a long-acting IL-22 analog. This analog is currently undergoing Phase 1 clinical evaluation to assess its safety and tolerability in both healthy participants with and without obesity. The results of this evaluation are expected to be available in the first half of 2024.\n\nOne of the key features of their product is its ability to harness the innate biology of IL-22. IL-22 is a molecule that plays a role in regulating the immune response and promoting tissue repair. By using an analog of IL-22, Cytoki Pharma aims to enhance its therapeutic potential and develop a medicine that can effectively treat diseases involving the gut-brain-liver axis.\n\nAnother unique aspect of Cytoki Pharma is their partnership with Novo Nordisk. In 2019, Cytoki Pharma licensed a full IL-22 analog program from Novo Nordisk, which has provided them with the foundation to develop their lead product.\n\nOverall, Cytoki Pharma's innovative approach to using IL-22 and their focus on addressing diseases involving the gut-brain-liver axis make them a promising biotechnology company. Their lead product, a long-acting IL-22 analog, has the potential to provide effective treatment options for conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, NAFLD, and IBD.",

Their innovative approach involves chemically linking an antibody to a cytotoxic payload, which delivers potent cytotoxic agents directly to cancer cells. This targeted delivery system allows for more effective treatment of solid tumors and liquid cancers that do not respond to other therapies.\n\nPheon takes a methodical approach to ADC development, using both novel and clinically validated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and arming them with either their proprietary payload platform or off-the-shelf linker payload combinations. This approach ensures a balance between safety and efficacy for each target, as there is no \"one size fits all\" solution in engineering ADCs.\n\nOne of Pheon's key features is their lead program, which targets a novel target highly expressed in a broad range of solid tumors. This program is expected to reach IND (Investigational New Drug) status within the next 18 months, indicating its progress towards clinical development.\n\nPheon Therapeutics is backed by expert healthcare investors and has a world-class leadership team with extensive experience in targeted oncology therapies and ADCs. They have established partnerships and licensing agreements with renowned pharmaceutical companies worldwide, further validating the potential of their technology.\n\nWith their state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry laboratories and commercial office, Pheon is well-equipped to develop and build a proprietary pipeline of follow-on ADCs to address the unmet medical needs of novel targets in hard-to-treat solid tumors across multiple cancer types.\n\nOverall, Pheon Therapeutics' unique approach, strong leadership team, and focus on developing next-generation ADCs position them as a promising company in the field of cancer therapeutics. Their innovative solutions have the potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes for patients with hard-to-treat cancers.",

This can contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge and potentially lead to the development of new therapies.\n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: While academic institutions and universities are important users of gene silencing technologies, they may not have the same level of resources and funding as pharmaceutical companies and biotech startups. The company's product may be more suitable for organizations with dedicated research and development efforts, rather than academic institutions that may have limited capacity for extensive drug discovery and development.\n\nContract research organizations (CROs): \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Contract research organizations (CROs) are companies that provide research services to pharmaceutical, biotech, and academic institutions. They often work on behalf of these organizations to conduct experiments and studies. CROs can be a target audience for this company as they can use the modified siRNA molecules to perform gene silencing experiments on behalf of their clients. This can help their clients in their drug discovery and development efforts, and provide additional revenue streams for the company.\n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: While CROs can benefit from using the company's modified siRNA molecules for gene silencing experiments, they may not be the primary target audience. CROs typically work on behalf of other organizations and may not have the same level of direct involvement in drug discovery and development. Therefore, focusing on CROs as a target audience may not yield the same level of impact and adoption as targeting pharmaceutical companies and biotech startups.",

They are targeting a specific type of antigens called Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) that are found in tumors. These antigens have been recognized as tumor-specific, but until now, they have been difficult to target with drugs. Hervolution has developed a powerful technology that stimulates both arms of the immune system to target these HERV tumor antigens. They deliver the immunogen using Adenoviral and RNA vectors. Hervolution has generated promising pre-clinical data showing the therapeutic potential of their immunotherapy for multiple types of cancer. They plan to enter First-In-Human (FIH) trials in 2024. What sets Hervolution apart is their unique approach to targeting HERV tumor antigens and their ability to stimulate both arms of the immune system. This could potentially lead to higher tumor control, survival rates, and tumor efficacy compared to other approaches. Additionally, Hervolution has assembled a strong team of industry experts and has secured funding from private investors and the European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund to support their research and development efforts.",

They are likely to be interested in the company's solution as it offers a potential improvement in tumor control and survival rates. \n\nBiomedical researchers: \nBiomedical researchers studying tumor antigens and immunotherapies would be interested in the company's product as it provides a new approach to targeting specific antigens found in tumors. They could potentially use the company's immunotherapies in their research studies. \n\nPharmaceutical companies: \nPharmaceutical companies that are developing immunotherapies or looking to expand their portfolio in the field of oncology would be interested in the company's product. The company's solution offers a novel approach to targeting HERVs in tumors, which could potentially improve the efficacy of immunotherapies. \n\nCancer patients: \nCancer patients who have HERVs in their tumors and are undergoing immunotherapy treatment would be the end-users of the company's product. They would be interested in the company's solution as it offers the potential for improved tumor control and survival rates. \n\nBad user targets: \nRegulatory agencies: \nRegulatory agencies responsible for approving and monitoring immunotherapies would be interested in the company's product. The company's solution, if proven effective, could potentially receive regulatory approval and be used as a treatment option for cancer patients. \n\nAnalysis: \nWhile regulatory agencies are important stakeholders in the approval and monitoring of immunotherapies, they are not the primary users or customers of the company's product. Their interest lies in the regulatory approval process rather than the direct use or application of the product.

                "text": "Discoveries made by our founders and other researchers in recent years show that fibroblasts, cells long known for their structural role in both health and disease, surprisingly also have a far-reaching influence on the primary players of the immune system, including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells and macrophages. We\u2019re developing new treatments that modulate these fibroblast-driven immune conversations, with the goal of increasing anti-cancer immune activity in the tumor microenvironment or diminishing the overactive immune response in inflammatory diseases. Through single-cell sequencing and other high-resolution technologies, our founders identified previously unknown activated fibroblast populations that share features of immune cells and actively influence immune effector cells in disease. Fibroblast-immune interactions are implicated as drivers of disease in multiple solid tumors, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus and Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. In tumors, activated fibroblasts contribute to an immunosuppressive environment, interfering with response to checkpoint inhibitors. Specialist fibroblast populations also drive the creation of tertiary lymphoid structures which have been associated with improved outcomes in cancer patients. In chronic inflammatory diseases, activated fibroblasts influence immune activity both directly and indirectly, in addition to playing a key role in structural remodeling and tissue integrity. Image of an inflamed joint, courtesy of Dr Jenny Marshall and Dr Triin Major. Advancing therapies to patients Our approach signals a new era in immunotherapy. We\u2019re urgently progressing a portfolio of sophisticated first-in-class antibody programs towards the clinic. We are also exploring important new targets in fibroblast-immune biology ourselves and in partnership with others. Our activities are underpinned by highly specialist data analytics, complex tissue assays, human tissue focus and a deep understanding of antibody engineering. As a primary component of the stroma surrounding tumors, activated fibroblasts play a major role in shaping the environment in which cancers grow. Our goal is to reshape the tumor microenvironment, to enable the body\u2019s immune system to better attack and destroy the tumor. Leveraging new insights into fibroblast-immune biology, our unique therapies are designed to result in improved immune cell infiltration and anti-cancer activity. Activated fibroblasts can both promote and suppress immune activity in inflammatory diseases by signaling immune cells. By understanding these communications, we are developing approaches to reduce inflammation and autoimmune activity."

                "text": "Redirecting the fibroblast-immune conversation to develop impactful therapies for patients Mestag is an immunotherapy company harnessing new insights into fibroblast-immune cell interactions to develop innovative treatments for cancer and inflammatory diseases. Through our unique understanding of fibroblast biology, we are advancing a pipeline of first-in-class tailored antibody programs and exploring innovative targets for new treatments. New approaches are urgently needed We are working with urgency towards a future in which the 50-70 percent of cancer patients who fail to respond to checkpoint inhibitors, and the 60 percent of patients with inflammatory disease who fail to achieve durable clinical remission can benefit from immunotherapies. Oncology: Activated fibroblasts play important roles in shaping the tumor environment and depending on context, may inhibit or stimulate potent anti-tumor immune responses in cancer. Our oncology programs are aimed at unleashing the body\u2019s immune responses to fight cancer by boosting immune cell infiltration and improving immune cell function. Our goal is to develop highly effective new antibody-based treatments for patients with solid tumors not well served by current therapeutic approaches. Inflammatory disease: In inflammatory disease we are focused on targeting central inflammatory pathways to shut down pathogenic immune responses and promote resolution of inflammation. Our sophisticated antibody therapeutics aim to dampen pro-inflammatory processes of both the innate and adaptive immune system to develop therapies that lead to lasting remission for patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. At Mestag, our teams are working on new targets that could lead to innovative future therapeutics. We do this in-house and together with our partner, Janssen Biotech, Inc.

The faulty COL2A1 gene disrupts the production of type II collagen, which is essential for chondrocytes to line up, mature, and convert into bone. This leads to impaired bone formation and can also affect vision and hearing. Currently, there is a lack of effective therapies for these rare bone disorders, leaving patients with limited options for managing their condition and improving their quality of life. Innoskel aims to address this problem by developing innovative gene therapies that target the cells responsible for cartilage formation and bone growth, with the goal of correcting the faulty COL2A1 gene and improving bone formation in patients with rare bone disorders.",

They would benefit from the availability of a gene therapy that could potentially alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients. \n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: While patient advocacy groups are important stakeholders in the rare bone disorder community, they are not the primary users of the gene therapy. Their role is to raise awareness, support research, and advocate for better treatments. While they would benefit from the availability of a gene therapy, their influence on the adoption and usage of the therapy may be limited. Therefore, targeting patient advocacy groups as the primary user segment may not be the most effective approach.\n\nRegulatory authorities and policymakers: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Regulatory authorities and policymakers involved in healthcare and drug approvals could be a target audience as they play a crucial role in evaluating and approving new therapies. They would benefit from understanding the potential benefits and risks of the gene therapy for rare bone disorders and making informed decisions regarding its approval and accessibility.\n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: Regulatory authorities and policymakers are important stakeholders in the approval and accessibility of new therapies. However, they are not the primary users or beneficiaries of the gene therapy. Their role is to evaluate and approve therapies based on their safety and efficacy. While they would benefit from understanding the potential benefits and risks of the gene therapy, their influence on the adoption and usage of the therapy may be limited. Therefore, targeting regulatory authorities and policymakers as the primary user segment may not be the most effective approach.",

They are likely to be interested in new treatment options that can improve patient outcomes and expand their treatment options.\n[Analysis (why it is a good target)]: Oncologists and Hematologists are the primary users who directly treat cancer patients and are actively seeking new and improved treatment options. They have the expertise and knowledge to understand the potential benefits of antibody therapeutics for solid tumors and are likely to be early adopters of such therapies.\n\nPharmaceutical companies: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Pharmaceutical companies are constantly seeking new therapies and treatments to add to their product pipelines. A company developing antibody therapeutics for solid tumors would be of interest to these companies as a potential partnership or acquisition opportunity.\n[Analysis (why it is a good target)]: Pharmaceutical companies have the resources and infrastructure to bring new therapies to market. They are actively looking for innovative treatments to add to their product pipelines and a company developing antibody therapeutics for solid tumors would be an attractive partnership or acquisition opportunity for them.\n\nInvestors and venture capitalists: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Investors and venture capitalists are interested in funding and supporting innovative companies with promising technologies and potential for high returns. A company developing antibody therapeutics for solid tumors would be targeting this group of users to secure funding and support for their research and development efforts.\n[Analysis (why it is a good target)]: Investors and venture capitalists play a crucial role in providing funding and support for early-stage companies. A company developing antibody therapeutics for solid tumors has the potential for high returns and can attract the attention of investors and venture capitalists who are looking for promising opportunities in the healthcare sector.\n\nBad user targets: \nCancer patients: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Cancer patients, particularly those with solid tumors, are in need of effective treatment options. A company developing antibody therapeutics specifically for the treatment of solid tumors would be targeting this group of users who are actively seeking new and improved treatment options.\n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: While cancer patients are the ultimate beneficiaries of new treatment options, they are not the primary users who can directly influence the adoption and use of antibody therapeutics for solid tumors. Their input and feedback are important, but they are not the main target audience for the company.\n\nBiotechnology researchers and scientists: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Biotechnology researchers and scientists are always looking for new technologies and approaches to advance their research and develop new therapies. A company developing antibody therapeutics for solid tumors would be of interest to this group as a potential collaboration or source of new research tools.\n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: While biotechnology researchers and scientists may be interested in collaborating with a company developing antibody therapeutics for solid tumors, they are not the primary users who can directly benefit from these therapies.

Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which harms both cancer and healthy cells, Spirea's ADCs are specifically designed to kill cancer cells only, resulting in better patient outcomes.\n\nWhat sets Spirea apart is their flexible and innovative approach to building ADCs. They have developed a technology that allows more drug payload to be directed specifically to the tumor cells, increasing the therapeutic effect while reducing toxic side effects. By delivering the right amount of the right drug to the right cells, Spirea aims to unlock a new generation of powerful and well-tolerated medicines for a wide range of cancers.\n\nThe company has received recognition and support from various sources, including pre-seed funding from IP Group and a grant from Innovate UK. They have also assembled a team of experts, including Dr. Myriam Ouberai, the CEO and founder, who has significant experience in drug delivery and biopharmaceuticals, and Adam Collier, the Chief Business Officer, with over 15 years of experience in biotech management.\n\nSpirea's technology has been presented at prestigious conferences and has generated significant interest in the scientific community. Their high drug-to-antibody ratio ADC platform technology has been granted a UK patent, further validating its potential. The company has also secured financing to develop their pipeline of ADC therapeutics and aims to reshape the future of cancer treatment by providing safer and more effective options for patients.",

                "text": "Montis Biosciences is a company that focuses on developing novel immune-oncology therapeutics to target and treat cancer. They aim to exploit the interaction between perivascular macrophages (a type of immune cell) and tumor vasculature (blood vessels in tumors) to restore a favorable immune response and improve the vasculature in cancerous conditions. Their approach involves using single cell RNA sequencing data to understand the communication between perivascular macrophages and tumor endothelial cells (cells lining the blood vessels in tumors). By targeting this interaction, Montis Biosciences aims to drive and sustain immune reactions against solid tumors. \n\nThe key features of Montis Biosciences' product or service include:\n1. Targeting the tumor stroma from a different angle: Montis Biosciences recognizes that the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in tumor growth, therapy resistance, and metastasis. They focus on targeting perivascular macrophages, a subclass of macrophages that are often overlooked in immuno-oncology, to disrupt the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and improve treatment outcomes.\n2. Restoring the tumor vasculature: Montis Biosciences acknowledges the importance of the tumor vasculature in cancer progression. Rather than destroying the blood vessels, they aim to use them to guide the correct immune cells to the tumor, enhancing the effectiveness of immune-based therapies.\n3. Unique target screening platform: Montis Biosciences has developed a unique target screening platform that allows them to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention. By leveraging single cell RNA sequencing data, they can uncover the immune-related functions of endothelial cells and perivascular macrophages, leading to the development of a first-in-class therapeutic pipeline.\n4. Backed by scientific expertise: Montis Biosciences was founded based on the foundational science from the laboratories of Prof. Peter Carmeliet and Massimiliano Mazzone, who are renowned researchers in the field of angiogenesis and tumor inflammation. Their expertise and research contributions provide a strong scientific foundation for Montis Biosciences' approach.\n\nOverall, Montis Biosciences offers a unique and innovative approach to immune-oncology by targeting the interaction between perivascular macrophages and tumor vasculature. Their focus on restoring the tumor microenvironment and leveraging the tumor vasculature sets them apart from traditional therapies, potentially leading to more effective and sustainable treatments for cancer.",

The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in tumor growth, therapy resistance, and metastasis. However, current therapeutic strategies often overlook the role of perivascular macrophages, a subclass of macrophages that cuff the tumor vasculature. These macrophages sustain immune suppression and dysfunction of the tumor vasculature, contributing to the malignant immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumors. Additionally, the interaction between tumor endothelial cells and perivascular macrophages shapes the immune suppressive response. By targeting this interaction, Montis Biosciences aims to restore a favorable immune response and improve the vasculature in cancerous conditions.",

They are likely to be interested in therapies that target immune suppression and dysfunctional tumor vasculature to improve immune response against cancer.\n[Analysis (why it is a good target)]: Oncologists and cancer researchers are directly involved in the treatment and care of cancer patients. They have a deep understanding of the challenges and limitations of current cancer therapies. Therefore, they are likely to be interested in therapies that specifically target immune suppression and dysfunctional tumor vasculature, as these are key factors in cancer progression. Their expertise and knowledge can also contribute to the development and improvement of the company's therapies.\n\nPharmaceutical companies and biotech firms: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms are potential target users as they are involved in the development and production of cancer therapies. They may be interested in partnering with or acquiring the company's therapies that target the interaction between immune cells and tumor blood vessels.\n[Analysis (why it is a good target)]: Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms have the resources and expertise to further develop and commercialize the company's therapies. They have the infrastructure and distribution channels to bring these therapies to a wider market. Additionally, they are constantly seeking innovative and effective cancer therapies to expand their product portfolio. Partnering with or being acquired by a pharmaceutical company or biotech firm can provide the necessary funding and support for the company's growth and success.\n\nBad user targets: \nCancer patients: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Cancer patients are a target audience as they are the individuals who would directly benefit from the company's therapies. They may be interested in accessing treatments that can improve their immune response against cancer and potentially improve their treatment outcomes.\n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: While cancer patients are the ultimate beneficiaries of the company's therapies, they are not the primary target users. Cancer patients typically rely on their oncologists and healthcare institutions to recommend and administer treatments. They may not have the knowledge or resources to directly access the company's therapies. Therefore, targeting cancer patients directly may not be the most effective strategy for the company's growth and adoption.\n\nHospitals and healthcare institutions: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Hospitals and healthcare institutions are potential target users as they are the organizations that provide cancer treatment and care. They may be interested in incorporating the company's therapies into their treatment protocols to improve patient outcomes.\n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: While hospitals and healthcare institutions play a crucial role in cancer treatment, they are not the primary decision-makers when it comes to adopting new therapies. The decision to incorporate a new therapy into treatment protocols is often made by oncologists and cancer researchers. Therefore, targeting hospitals and healthcare institutions directly may not be the most effective strategy for the company's growth and adoption.\n\nGovernment health agencies and regulatory bodies: \n[Initial Description (target description)]: Government health agencies and regulatory bodies are potential target users as they play a crucial role in approving and regulating cancer therapies. They may be interested in evaluating the safety and efficacy of the company's therapies and potentially approving them for use in cancer treatment.\n[Analysis (why it is a bad target)]: While government health agencies and regulatory bodies are important stakeholders in the approval and regulation of cancer therapies, they are not the primary users or customers of the company's therapies. Their role is to evaluate and ensure the safety and efficacy of therapies, but they do not directly use or benefit from them. Therefore, targeting government health agencies and regulatory bodies directly may not be the most effective strategy for the company's growth and adoption.",

Their goal is to harness the power of the arenavirus to activate the immune system and target cancer cells specifically. \n\nTheir product is an arenavirus-based drug candidate that is designed to replicate within cancer cells, triggering precise immune responses and activating all relevant immune cell types against primary tumors and metastases. This approach allows for a quantum leap in immuno-oncology by generating a maximal immune response specifically targeted against a patient's cancer and its metastases. \n\nWhat sets Abalos Therapeutics apart is their proprietary Fast Evolution Platform, which allows them to optimize the anti-tumoral properties of their viruses, such as specific tumor-tropism, infection rate, and prolonged tumor persistence. This results in a strong innate and adaptive immune response against the cancer cells, re-programming essential natural components of the patient's immune system to eliminate the malignant tumor tissue. \n\nUnlike short-term oncolytic approaches, Abalos' arenavirus candidates have the ability to trigger a precise and directed anti-tumoral immune response that also targets distant metastases, enabling long-term disease control. \n\nOverall, Abalos Therapeutics offers a unique and differentiated approach to cancer treatment by leveraging the immune stimulation of the arenavirus to provide a powerful anti-cancer attack.",

Cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells, leading to the formation of tumors and the potential for metastasis. Current treatment options for cancer, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, have limitations and can cause significant side effects. There is a need for innovative approaches that can specifically target cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy cells and tissues. Abalos Therapeutics aims to harness the unique immune stimulation of the arenavirus to develop a novel anti-cancer approach. By leveraging the immune system's power, their goal is to activate all relevant immune cell types against primary tumors and metastases, providing a more targeted and effective treatment option for cancer patients.",

They have developed the Lakhesys platform, which is an end-to-end cell foundry that uses deep process optimization and single-use, microfluidic bioprocessors to improve the manufacturing of these therapies. By eliminating the need for large-scale infrastructure and reducing costs, Astraveus aims to make these life-changing therapies more accessible to patients.\n\nThe key features of the Lakhesys platform are its modular and microfluidic cell foundries. These foundries allow for the optimization and miniaturization of cellular therapies and their manufacturing. By leveraging the ability of therapeutic cells to multiply in the patient's body, Astraveus can use minute amounts of resources without compromising efficacy. This not only reduces the cost and environmental impact of these therapies but also overcomes the logistical challenges typically associated with manufacturing them.\n\nWhat sets Lakhesys apart is its use of microfluidic bioprocessors, which mimic organ perfusion and accelerate the molecular exchanges needed to transform cells into therapeutic agents. This unique manufacturing process allows for increased mass transfer, precise control, and minimized waste, resulting in higher quality products obtained at a lower cost and reduced environmental impact. Additionally, Lakhesys enables parallel production of up to 100 minibatches simultaneously, further increasing manufacturing throughput.\n\nAstraveus is supported by funding from the European Union and the French Minister of Education and Innovation, which highlights the recognition and support they have received for their innovative approach to cell and gene therapy manufacturing.\n\nIn summary, Astraveus is transforming the manufacturing of cell and gene therapies through their Lakhesys platform. By optimizing and miniaturizing the manufacturing process using modular and microfluidic cell foundries, they are able to reduce costs, increase manufacturing throughput, and improve the quality of these therapies. This ultimately makes these life-changing treatments more accessible to patients.",
